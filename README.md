###Front End test 2

###Instructions
Please build a responsive web application that displays a map control with the following features:
* Using the data set found within dataset.xls, drop a series of pins on the map using lat & lon of each POI
* The data MAY be uploaded and accessed via a web service, the server technology being of your choosing
* The map should center over the pins, at an appropriate zoom level to view all the pins
* The pins should have a popup that contains the description / title of the pin

We want to understand how you've built the application, you may use any 3rd party libraries of your choosing, please highlight which ones you have chosen.

Please fork this repo to your personal Github account, and once complete allow us with access to your repo.

When submitting your test, please specify any tools you have used, including the editor you used to write your code, and the instruments used to test performance.

###General requirements and considerations
Generally, you should build the web page in the way that you feel it should be built, however the following should be taken into consideration: 

* Accessibility: 
Ensure that your mark-up takes into account basic accessibility standards. For example alt attributes and similar are set. Please also consider page weight.

* Standards compliance: 
Ensure that your mark-up is W3C compliant. For example, all tags are correctly closed, tags are nested correctly and that all necessary attributes for a tag are set. Your page should validate against the online W3C checker.

* Semantics: 
Ensure that your mark-up is semantic. For example, header tags are used where relevant, information follows a logical flow throughout the document and that information is displayed using the most appropriate tag.

* JavaScript:
Ensure you write neat, tidy JavaScript that you would consider suitable for a live web site.

* Browsers:
The page should function and resemble the creative in the following web browsers:
** FireFox  (latest)
** Internet Explorer (latest)
** Safari (latest)
** Google Chrome (latest)
